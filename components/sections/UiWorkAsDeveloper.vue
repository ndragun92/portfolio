    Why do i love to work as developer?
    <p>
      <strong>1. Be rewarded</strong>
      Thing that I love about this job is that I am learning something new everyday.
      Each day I meet new problems which I have to solve.
      Each day brings something new, something exciting.
      Working as developer is my passion. I love to spend time coding and reading articles!
      In the end all the effort that I put working is already or will be rewarded!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. Ability to work alone or to become part of something bigger</strong>
      It is totally up to me! I can work on projects alone if I want that or I can
      be part of something bigger. I have opportunity to meet a lot of great people,
      great developers. Being a part of something bigger is more challenging but I can get only
      benefits from that, I will grow faster, learn more, share my own experience with others!
    </p>

      <strong>3. Ability to work remotely or from office</strong>
      In this job you have opportunity to work fully/partly remote or even from office.
      If you feel like you are more productive from working in office you can do that as well!
      I personally like to organize my own day. I am more productive when I work from home.
      I always give my best! Also once I am done with work i don't have to drive from office to home and lose that time on road. I rather spend that time with my family.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4. How do I try to stay successful?</strong>
      In order to be successful I am giving my best in everything that I do!
      In this job I have to be up to date with everything.
      Things that I am using/coding today might be different tomorrow.
      Community is growing, a lot of new things shows up on daily basis.
      By reading articles and learning new stuff I can improve my skills and make my code even better!
